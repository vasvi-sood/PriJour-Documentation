<h1>What is PriJour?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-prijour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The web app allows users to express their feelings by typing them on a digital canvas, which then aims to analyze their feelings and provide them with what they really need. The data collected over a period of time is visualized as a graph, which aids in deciding whether the individual requires medical assistance, and the report may be shared with a doctor.  A special questionnaire is also designed that analyses the user’s psychological condition and calculates his or her happiness index.</p>
<p>Not only this, the website also includes a trained bot - “Mamta” to help users to feel positive and happy just how everyone feels on the lap of their mother. This bot keeps a user engaged through interactive questions.</p>
<p>The user’s journal entries and responses to those simple questions produce a personalized feed of quotes, book recommendations, blog posts, videos, and song therapy, which works wonders as opposed to scrolling through endless twitter, facebook, or instagram posts, which do more harm than good. PriJour offers a selection of carefully curated and limited feeds, allowing users to reflect on their own lives. These feeds are based on the concepts of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).</p>
<div class="section" id="why-the-need">
<h2>Why the need?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-the-need" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The impact of our mental wellbeing can be felt in all aspects of our lives. A positive and healthy mind develops into a happier life. Is there a way to keep a check on your mental health in today’s era, where stress and frustration are the new normal?
PriJour functions similarly to an emotional spa or a free talk therapist, allowing users to spill all of their feelings, without anyone judging them, in the form of a private journal. Although journaling has its own merits but to top it all, the web app gives users a personalised emotional spa experience - where the massage is positivity, the scrub to remove dead cells is powerful words and in the end we shower them with positive affirmation!</p>
